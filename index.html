                <p>"And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its
                    horns
                    and blasphemous names on its heads. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like
                    a
                    bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne
                    and
                    great authority. One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed,
                    and
                    the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given
                    his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who
                    can
                    fight against it?”"</p>
